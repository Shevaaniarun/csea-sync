        Sync is an intra-college symposium hosted by the Department of Computer
        Science. It is conducted with the notion of aggrandizing the intellect
        and kindling the passion for computer science in budding engineers. Sync
        promotes inter-department collaboration and interdisciplinary
        activities. Apart from technical events, it focuses on other
        nontechnical events to maintain the perfect equilibrium between tech and
        non-tech events. This year, we have decided to have the events around
        Digital Well-being. Sync ‘25 is about to blossom afresh on 27th and 28th
        of September, 2025. Encompassing multifarious events, this version has
        the benchmark features to enthrall the multitude, albeit in a
        sustainable manner. Every experience brings a greater clarity of vision
        and thus with the past experiences, Sync ‘25 is all set to reach further
        horizons.
